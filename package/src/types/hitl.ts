/**
 * Run-level configuration controlling HITL semantics. **HITL is OFF by
 * default** for now — the SDK ships the interrupt machinery, but the
 * default stays opt-in until host UIs (notably LibreChat) ship the
 * approval-rendering affordances needed to surface interrupts to end
 * users. Without that UI, an interrupt with no resolver looks like a
 * hung tool-call card. Hosts opt in explicitly with
 * `{ enabled: true }`. The intent is to flip this default to ON in a
 * future minor once the consumer ecosystem is ready to render
 * interrupts end-to-end.
 *
 * When enabled (`{ enabled: true }`):
 *
 *   - `PreToolUse` hooks returning `decision: 'ask'` raise a real
 *     LangGraph `interrupt()` instead of being treated as a synchronous
 *     deny.
 *   - `Run.create` installs a `MemorySaver` checkpointer fallback on the
 *     run's compile options if the host did not provide one, since
 *     LangGraph requires a checkpointer to suspend and resume.
 *
 * When disabled (the default — omitted, or `{ enabled: false }`):
 * `ask` decisions are fail-closed (blocked with an error
 * `ToolMessage`) and no checkpointer is implicitly attached. This
 * matches the pre-HITL behavior so existing hosts upgrading the SDK
 * see no change until they're ready to wire the resume UI.
 *
 * ## Scope: every tool the ToolNode runs
 *
 * The interrupt path is wired into both `dispatchToolEvents` (the
 * event-driven path) and `runDirectToolWithLifecycleHooks` (the
 * direct path used by `directToolNames` entries — graph-managed
 * handoff/subagent tools and every in-process `graphTool` instance).
 * `PreToolUse` hooks fire for every tool the ToolNode invokes, and
 * HITL approval gates every tool whose hook returns `'ask'` —
 * regardless of whether the tool is dispatched as an event or
 * invoked in-process. This convergence happened in two follow-up
 * commits to the original HITL surface (see `Graph.ts` —
 * `hookRegistry`/`humanInTheLoop` are passed in both
 * event-driven and legacy branches; and `ToolNode.runDirectToolWithLifecycleHooks`
 * — direct-path tools build their own single-tool `tool_approval`
 * payload and raise `interrupt()` the same way the event path does).
 *
 * Practical implications:
 *   - Every host gets the full HITL surface across every tool the
 *     model calls — event-dispatched, direct, mixed.
 *   - `createToolPolicyHook` and `createWorkspacePolicyHook` apply
 *     uniformly. A hook can be registered without knowing or caring
 *     which path the tool will take.
 *   - Direct tools that the host opted into via `directToolNames` no
 *     longer bypass policy. If you need a tool to skip the hook
 *     surface entirely, omit it from any registered matcher.
 *
 * ## Resume re-execution: every tool in the interrupted batch
 *
 * LangGraph rolls back to the start of the interrupted node on
 * resume. That means **every tool in the same batch as the one that
 * interrupted re-runs from the top on the resume pass**, not just
 * the interrupting tool, and not just the direct half (this used to
 * be framed as a direct-tool-specific concern; it is not — it
 * applies to event-dispatched siblings too). Practical contract:
 *
 *   - The body of the interrupting tool itself runs **once** total
 *     (the first pass interrupted *before* the body, the resume pass
 *     ran the body after the host's decision was applied).
 *   - The body of any sibling tool that already executed in the
 *     same batch before the interrupting tool runs **twice** — once
 *     on the first pass, once on the resume pass.
 *   - `PreToolUse` hooks fire **once per pass per tool**. A hook
 *     that always returns `'ask'` will loop forever on resume; real
 *     hooks should be deterministic w.r.t. inputs and use the
 *     `'ask' → host approves → resume → hook returns 'allow'`
 *     pattern, where the second-pass `allow` reflects the host
 *     having recorded the approval (e.g., a session-scoped approved-
 *     paths set keyed by `runId`).
 *
 * Consequence: any tool with side effects MUST be idempotent if
 * there's any chance another tool in the same batch could trigger
 * an interrupt. This applies equally to direct tools (handoffs,
 * subagents) and to event tools.
 *
 * ## Note on idempotency
 *
 * Same root cause as the resume re-execution above: LangGraph
 * re-runs the interrupted node from the start on resume, which
 * fires `PreToolUse` hooks again. Hooks that produce side effects
 * (logging, external calls) will see at least two invocations per
 * paused turn — exactly two for the interrupting tool, possibly
 * more across siblings.
